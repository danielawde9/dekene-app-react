Code Refactoring: Split large components into smaller, reusable components by creating a Components.jsx file and moving components like SelectBranchComponent, TransactionForms, TotalsAndClosing, etc., into it.

Custom Hooks: Created a custom hook useFetchData to handle data fetching and reduce code repetition.

Memoization: Used useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive computations and functions to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Responsive Design: Improved the layout by using Ant Design's Grid system with gutter properties for better spacing and responsiveness.

Enhanced Feedback: Added Tooltip components to provide additional information to users when hovering over elements.

Simplified Forms: Reduced repetition in form fields by creating dynamic components where appropriate.

Remember User Preferences: Ensured the selected branch is saved in localStorage and reloaded when the app is reopened.

Improved Form Validation: Enhanced form validation with more precise rules and error messages.

Consistent Design Language: Ensured consistent styling across the app by using Ant Design components and following a cohesive theme.

Confirmation Prompts: Added confirmation modals and pop-ups for critical actions to prevent accidental data loss.

Accessibility: Added aria-labels and roles where appropriate for better accessibility.

Enhanced Tables with Pagination: While not adding new functions, ensured tables are properly scrollable and responsive.

Improved Navigation: Used Ant Design's Tabs component effectively for better navigation between different sections.
